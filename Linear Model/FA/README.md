<h1>Factor Analysis (FA)</h1>

Factor Analysis (FA) is an exploratory data analysis method used to search influential underlying factors or latent variables from a set of observed variables. It helps in data interpretations by reducing the number of variables. It extracts maximum common variance from all variables and puts them into a common score.

Factor analysis is widely utilized in market research, advertising, psychology, finance, and operation research. Market researchers use factor analysis to identify price-sensitive customers, identify brand features that influence consumer choice, and helps in understanding channel selection criteria for the distribution channel.



Factor analysis is a method for investigating whether a number of variables of interest X1, X2,……., Xl, are linearly related to a smaller number of unobservable factors F1, F2,..……, Fk.



<h3>Assumptions:</h3>
- There are no outliers in data.
- Sample size should be greater than the factor.
- There should not be perfect multicollinearity.
- There should not be homoscedasticity between the variables.


<h3>Types of Factor Analysis</h3>
- Exploratory Factor Analysis: It is the most popular factor analysis approach among social and management researchers. Its basic assumption is that any observed variable is directly associated with any factor.
- Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA): Its basic assumption is that each factor is associated with a particular set of observed variables. CFA confirms what is expected on the basic.


<h3>How does Factor Analysis Work?</h3>
The primary objective of factor analysis is to reduce the number of observed variables and find unobservable variables. These unobserved variables help the market researcher to conclude the survey. This conversion of the observed variables to unobserved variables can be achieved in two steps:

Factor Extraction: In this step, the number of factors and approach for extraction selected using variance partitioning methods such as principal components analysis and common factor analysis.
Factor Rotation: In this step, rotation tries to convert factors into uncorrelated factors — the main goal of this step to improve the overall interpretability. There are lots of rotation methods that are available such as: Varimax rotation method, Quartimax rotation method, and Promax rotation method.


<h3>Factor Analysis Vs. Principle Component Analysis</h3>
 - PCA components explain the maximum amount of variance while factor analysis explains the covariance in data.
 - PCA components are fully orthogonal to each other whereas factor analysis does not require factors to be orthogonal.
 - PCA component is a linear combination of the observed variable while in FA, the observed variables are linear combinations of the unobserved variable or factor.
 - PCA components are uninterpretable. In FA, underlying factors are labelable and interpretable.
 - PCA is a kind of dimensionality reduction method whereas factor analysis is the latent variable method.
 - PCA is a type of factor analysis. PCA is observational whereas FA is a modeling technique.
