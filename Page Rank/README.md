<p>PageRank (PR) is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank websites in their search engine results.</p>

<b>PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is.
     The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.</b>
